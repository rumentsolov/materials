Areas in Matrix
We are given a matrix of letters of size N * M. Two cells are neighbors if they share a common wall. Write a program to find the connected areas of neighbor cells holding the same letter. Display the total number of areas and the number of areas for each alphabetical letter (ordered by alphabetical order). 
On the first line is given the number of rows.

Hint
Initially mark all cells as unvisited. Start a recursive DFS traversal (or BFS) from each unvisited cell and mark all reached cells as visited. Each DFS traversal will find one of the connected areas.

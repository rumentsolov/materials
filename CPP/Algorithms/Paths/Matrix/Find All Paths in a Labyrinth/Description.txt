Find All Paths in a Labyrinth
You are given a labyrinth. Your goal is to find all paths from the start (cell 0, 0) to the exit, marked with 'e'. 
    • Empty cells are marked with a dash '-'.
    • Walls are marked with a star '*'.
On the first line, you will receive the dimensions of the labyrinth. Next, you will receive the actual labyrinth.
The order of the paths does not matter.

Hints
    • Create methods for reading and finding all paths in the labyrinth.

    • Create a static list that will hold directions (basically the path).

    • Finding all paths should be recursive.

    • Implement all helper methods that are present in the code above

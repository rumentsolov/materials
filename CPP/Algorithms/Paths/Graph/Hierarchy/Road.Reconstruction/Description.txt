Road Reconstruction
Write a program that finds all the roads without which buildings in the city will become unreachable. 
You will receive how many buildings the town has on the first line, then you will receive the number of streets and finally, for each street, you will receive which buildings it connects. Find all the streets that are important and cannot be removed and print them in ascending order (e. g. 3 0 should be printed as 0 3).
Input
    • On the first line, you will receive the number of buildings.
    • On the second line, you will receive the amount of the streets (n).
    • On the next "n" lines you will receive which buildings each street connects.
Output
    • On the first line print: "Important streets:".
    • On the next lines (if any) print the street in the format: "{firstBuilding} {secondBuilding}".
    • The order of the output does not matter if you print all the important streets.

Binomial Coefficients
Write a program that finds the binomial coefficient  for given non-negative integers n and k. The coefficient can be found recursively by adding the two numbers above using the formula: 

However, this leads to calculating the same coefficient multiple times (a problem that also occurs when solving the Fibonacci problem recursively). Use memoization to improve performance.

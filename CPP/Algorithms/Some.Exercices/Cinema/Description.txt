Judge.
Cinema
Write a program that prints all of the possible distributions of a group of friends in a cinema hall. On the first line, you will be given all of the friends' names separated by comma and space.  Until you receive the command "generate" you will be given some of those friends' names and a number of the place that they want to have. (format: "{name} - {place}") So here comes the tricky part. Those friends want only to sit in the place that they have chosen. They cannot sit in other places. For more clarification see the examples below.
Output
Print all the possible ways to distribute the friends having in mind that some of them want a particular place and they will sit there only. The order of the output does not matter.
Constrains
    â€¢ The friends' names and the number of the place will always be valid.

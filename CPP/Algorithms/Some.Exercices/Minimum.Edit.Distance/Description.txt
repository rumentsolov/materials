We have two strings, s1 and s2. The goal is to obtain s2 from s1 by applying the following operations:
    • replace(i, x) – in s1, replace the symbol at index  with the character x
    • insert(i, x) – in s1, inserts the character x at index i
    • delete(i) – from s1, remove the character at index i
We are only allowed to modify s1, s2 always stays unchanged. Each of the three operations has a certain cost associated with it (positive integer number). 
Note: the cost of the replace(i, x) operation is 0 if it does not change the character.
The goal is to find the sequence of operations which will produce s2 from s1 with minimal cost.
Input
    • The input consists of five lines.
    • The first line is the replacement cost.
    • The second line is the insert cost.
    • The third line is the delete cost. 
    • After that on the next two lines are the two strings s1 and s2.

Comments:
Indices refer to the original s1 string – DELETE(3) deletes the symbol at index 3 from abracadabra, not from the modified string mabracadabra after the INSERT(0, m) operation.

    1. Trains
As a promising tinker, you are part of Dick Simnel’s locomotion scheduler team.
Given a schedule containing the arrival and departure time of trains in a station, find the minimum number of platforms needed to avoid delay in any train’s arrival.
    1. Input
    • The input will come from the console on two lines:
        ◦ The first line will be a sequence of numbers representing the train arrival times.
        ◦ The second line will be a sequence of numbers representing the train departure times.
    2. Output
    • The output is a single integer representing the minimum number of platforms, so no trains are delayed.
    3. Constraints
    • The input numbers will be valid floating-point numbers representing 24h clock system as an example
[1.30, 14.20, 6.50, 4.20] etc.
    • When two trains are scheduled to arrive and depart simultaneously, depart the train first.
    • Arrivals and departures will always be sequences with equal length.

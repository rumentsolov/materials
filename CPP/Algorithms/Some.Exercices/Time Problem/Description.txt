Time
This time you are master of the time itself.
Do you know what a persistent timeline is? Well even if you don't you are about to understand. You need to rebuild the timeline of the universe. Which universe? This one, maybe if you are lucky enough. 
You will be given two sequences of integers representing two timeline versions. You need to extract from both sequences the single correct timeline that can be retrieved by finding the longest subsequence of equal integers from both timelines and also finding its length.
Input
    • The first line integers represent the first timeline separated by spaces.
    • The second line integers represent the second timeline separated by spaces
Output
    • On the first line print the correct timeline, if there are more than one optimal timeline print the rightmost
    • On the second line print the length of that timeline
Constraints
    • All numbers will be valid integers
    • The length of the timelines will be between [1…5000]

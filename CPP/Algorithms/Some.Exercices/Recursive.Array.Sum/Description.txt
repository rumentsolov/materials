Recursive Array Sum
Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in an integer array. Use recursion.
Note: In practice, this recursion should not be used here (instead use an iterative solution), this is just an exercise.
Examples

1 2 3 4
10

-1 0 1
0

Hints
Write a recursive method. It will take as arguments the input array and an index. 
    • The method should return the current element + the sum of all next elements (obtained by recursively calling it):

    • The recursion should stop when there are no more elements in the array:

    • This is how the complete solution should look:

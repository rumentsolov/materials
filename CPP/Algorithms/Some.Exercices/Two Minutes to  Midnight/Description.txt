Two Minutes to Midnight
Well, it is dark outside and many unnatural creatures dwell in the dark. There is nothing more fearsome than Midnight and you have only two minutes.
You are on an adventure and you have found yourself stuck in front of a great challenge. There is a door blocking your path it will unlock after you have guessed the correct number which is the answer to the following riddle:
In how many ways can you select the loot inside the treasure room, given that you have N items and you can only pick K of those?

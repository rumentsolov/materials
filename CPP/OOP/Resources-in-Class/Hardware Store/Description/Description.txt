Hardware Store
You are given 4 files: main.cpp, Hardware.h, Laptop.h and Store.h.
You are given the main() function, which reads a single integer value of memory (N).
    • The next N lines are special command strings;
    • “buy” command – creates new Laptop in the Hardware Store;
    • “remove” command – removes a Laptop from a given INDEX from the Hardware Store (provided indexes will always be valid);
    • “copy” command – copies the data from one index to another index in the Hardware Store; 
Your task is to study the provided Skeleton and implement the missing functionalities for Store.cpp and Laptop.cpp files;
For Store.cpp – you should implement the missing functions.
For Laptop.cpp – you should implement everything required from the Laptop.h file with few things in mind;
    • At the end of the constructor you should call printInfo() followed by printing “ is being created” and a newline;
    • At the end of the destructor you should call printInfo() followed by printing “ is being destroyed” and a newline;
    • At the end of the copy-constructor you should print “Copy construction for ” followed by a call to  printInfo() and a newline;
    • At the end of the copy-assignment operator you should print “Copy assignment for ” followed by a call to  printInfo() and a newline;
    • If a self-copy is detected you should print “Self-copy prevented for ” followed by a call to  printInfo() and a newline;

Important hint: 
Remember what happens to a std::vector’s elements when it is constantly growing with call to .push_back()/.emplace_back().  
Also remember what happens to a std::vector’s elements when an element is deleted from an index, which is not the last.
Last but, not least remember what happens to a std::vector’s elements, when the vector is being destoyed.


Example: 
3 commands:
    • buy Acer 1200.14 15.6
    • copy 0 0
    • remove 0
output: 
Model: Acer, price: 1200.14, monitorSize: 15.6 is being created
Self-copy prevented for Model: Acer, price: 1200.14, monitorSize: 15.6
Model: Acer, price: 1200.14, monitorSize: 15.6 is being destroyed

Your task is to study the code and implement the function so that the code accomplishes the task described.
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the files you created. 
The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

Restrictions
There are no restrictions.

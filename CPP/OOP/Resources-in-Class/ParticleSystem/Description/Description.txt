Array Trouble
Your task is to write a program that represents dynamic array usage.
You are given an implementation of an “BrokenArray”.
Your task is to fix it by providing an implementation for the fixed version ‘FixedArray”.

You are given the main() function, parses and executes different commands.
If your implementation of the FixedArray class is correct – the output to the standard output will be correct.
If your implementation is wrong – the output will be wrong.

The FixedArray class should provide implementation for the functionalities that are used in the FixedArray.h file.
    • Constructor
    • Destructor
    • Copy constructor
    • Copy assignment operator
    • addValueToMemory() method – increases the underlying array values in memory
    • getMemorySumValue() – sums the value of all underlying element of the array in memory

The input reads integers numbers that represent commands listed in the Defines.h file
enum InputCommands
{
	CREATE                = 0,
	COPY_CONSTRUCT        = 1,
	COPY_ASSIGN    		= 2,
	SUM_ARRAY_DATA        = 3,
	INCR_ARRAY_DATA_VALUE = 4
};

Your task is to study the code and implement the function so that the code accomplishes the task described.
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the files you created. 
The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

Restrictions
You should only submit files with .h and .cpp extensions (in a .zip archive).
You should Not have folders in your .zip submission archive.

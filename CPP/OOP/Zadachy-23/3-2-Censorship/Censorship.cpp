/*
You are given some code, which reads a line of strings (separated by single spaces) which describe "copyrighted" strings. Then it reads several lines (until a line containing the string "end" is entered), and checks each of them against the copyrighted words:

路 If the line matches a copyrighted string, it is "blocked"

路 Otherwise it is printed back on the output

路 The last line "end" is not included in this logic, it just determines when the reading ends. No two lines will be the same.

路 After the end line, the program prints a line beginning with "Blocked: ", followed by all the blocked strings, separated by single spaces, in the order they were entered

The program handles input and output, but uses a class named Article13Filter to do the blocking and store the blocked strings.

Your task is to study the available code and create a file with code such that the program compiles successfully and accomplishes the task described above.

You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the file(s) YOU created. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

Input:
eussr censorship machines
notblocked
eussr
machines
hello
censorship
end

Output:
notblocked
hello
Blocked: eussr machines censorship

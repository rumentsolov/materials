/*
You are given a text in English. Let’s define a word as any sequence of alphabetical characters. Each of those
characters we will call a letter, but we will consider the uppercase and lowercase variant of a character in a word as
the same letter.
Write a program that reads the text (a single line on the console) and then reads lines, each containing a single
letter, until a line containing a '.' (dot) is entered. For each of those lines, print all words that contain the letter,
ordered alphabetically (capitals letters before lowercase letters), without duplicates – if no words contain that
letter, print "---" (three dashes)

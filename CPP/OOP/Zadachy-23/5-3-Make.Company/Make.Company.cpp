/*

You are given a program in a MakeCompanyMain.cpp, as well as a Company.h file, that reads information about
companies and writes it to the console.
Each company has:
An id (a 4-byte integer)
A name (a string containing a sequence of lowercase English letters a-z)
Employees by their initials (a vector of pairs of characters, containing at most 255 employee initials)

The MakeCompanyMain.cpp file reads the information from the console as a single line for each company,
containing:
•
•
•
•
•
•
company id string
space
company name
2 characters representing the initials of the first employee
Space
Again 2 characters, representing the second employee, etc
NOTE: there could be companies without employees, in which case the line ends with the company name.
For example, if we have the companies:
•
id = 42, name = "uni", employees = { {'I', 'K'}, {'S', 'N'} } and
id = 13, name = "joro", employees = { {'G', 'G' } }
Their representation as strings read by MemoryMain.cpp will be:
42 uni IK SN
13 joro GG
The program reads each line from the console, then calls a function named makeCompany to dynamically allocate
memory for a Company object and set its values, then prints its representation a back to the console (i.e. the
program should print the exact line it read), until a line containing the single string "end" is reached.
Your task is to create a file called MakeCompany.h containing the function makeCompany such that the program
compiles successfully and performs the described task.
Your file should resemble the following:
MakeCompany.h
#ifndef MAKE_COMPANY_H
#define MAKE_COMPANY_H
#include "Company.h"
// Place your code here
#endif // !MAKE_COMPANY_H
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the MakeCompany.h file. The Judge system has a
copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
Additional Requirements
Make sure you correctly create the Company objects and ensure that there are no memory leaks.
Examples

Input
42 uni IK SN
13 joro GG
end

Output
42 uni IK SN
13 joro GG

Input
188 noemployees
58 oneemployee SA

Output
188 noemployees
58 oneemployee SA

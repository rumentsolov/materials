Census
You are given code for a program that reads information about City objects (name, population), orders prints them in order of their population and calculates the total population (the sum of the populations of each City).
The provided code uses two functions, named initCity and groupByPopulation, to create cities and group them in increasing order of their population (in this case each "group" will be exactly 1 City).
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the files you created. 
The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
Restrictions
The provided code handles input and output.
No two cities will have an equal population. 
City names will be strings of letters from the English alphabet, without any whitespaces, digits or other symbols.
There will be no more than 10 cities in the input.

/*
You are given code for a program that reads Vectors from the console, sorts them in reverse order of their length (the Vector class defines methods for length calculation), and prints them (longest-first). For that, it uses a multiset and supplies an additional template parameter that instructs the multiset on how to compare two Vector objects.

Your task is to study the way the provided code and create types that allow the appropriate comparison of Vector objects, such that the resulting code accomplishes the task described.

You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the files you created.

The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file(s), in the same directory.

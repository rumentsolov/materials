/*
You are given 7 files: main.cpp, Defines.h, Structs.h, Hero.h, Archmage.h, DeathKnight.h and DrawRanger.h.
The classes ‘Archmage’, ‘DeathKnight’ and ‘DrawRanger’ represents your 3 heroes.
Each hero has the following attributes:
➢ name – the name of the character;
➢ maxMaxa – the character mana pool for casting spells. (If you don’t know what ‘mana’ is – think of it as
a currency required to cast a spell).
➢ baseManaRegenRate – tell you how much mana points your character restores when an
ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA is performed. Keep in mind that your character can NOT have more
mana points than his “maxMaxa”. Your character can restore mana points UP to his “maxMaxa”.
NOTE: The Archmage class has a special bonus attribute: “manaRegenModifier”, which scales up his mana
regeneration (multiplies baseManaRegenRate to manaRegenModifier) each time the character performs an
ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA.
Each character has his unique BASIC and ULTIMATE spells that are already predefined.
struct Spell {
std::string name;
//name of the spell
int
manaCost; //mana requirement to cast this spell
};

You are given the main() function, which first populates Archmange, DeathKnight, and DrawRanger classes
constructors and then reads a single integer value of memory (N).
-
The next N whitespace separated integer are special ActionType commands;
enum ActionType {
CAST_BASIC_SPELL,
CAST_ULTIMATE_SPELL,
REGENERATE_MANA
};
➢ “0” or ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL command – all heroes should TRY to casts their BASIS spells (if
they have enough mana points);
➢ “1” or ActionType::CAST_ ULTIMATE _SPELL command – all heroes should TRY to cast their ULTIMATE
spells (if they have enough mana points);
➢ “2” or ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA command – all heroes should use their ability to regenerate
mana;
Your task is to study the provided Skeleton and implement the missing functionalities for Archmage.cpp,
DeathKnight.cpp and DrawRanger.cpp files with a few things in mind:
After each ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL or ActionType::CAST_ULTIMATE_SPELL each hero should print to the
console a result of his actions.
➢ For a successful cast you should print: ‘spell name’ casted for ‘spell mana’ followed by a newline.
➢ For unsuccessful cast you should print: ‘spell name’ – not enough mana to cast ‘spell name’ followed by
a newline.
Note: ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA does NOT print any result to the console.
Special hero abilities:
➢ Archmage – if SpellType::ULTIMATE is successfully casted the Archmage gets immediately a free
ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA.
➢ DeathKnight – if SpellType::ULTIMATE is successfully casted the DeathKnight gets immediately a free
ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL. Important note: on the free basic cast spell you should print to the
console – ‘spell name’ casted for 0 mana.
➢ DrawRanger – if SpellType::BASIC is successfully casted the DrawRanger gets immediately a free
ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL. Important note: on the free basic cast spell you should print to the
console – ‘spell name’ casted for 0 mana.
Your task is to study the code and implement the function so that the code accomplishes the task described.
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the files you created.
The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
Restrictions
All heroes at any time can have mana points from [0, individual ‘maxMana’] inclusively;

/*
You are given some code, which reads a single string from the input and writes it to the output without any changes.

The code however doesnâ€™t compile. Figure out what file(s) needs to be created, and what file it needs to contain, so that the program compiles and runs as described.

You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the file(s) YOU created. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

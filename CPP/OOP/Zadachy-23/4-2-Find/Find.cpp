/*
You are given a program in a Main.cpp file that reads info about companies – name and id – and then reads a search id, finds a company with that id, and prints the info about that company. If no such company has been entered, the program prints "[not found]". To do the search, the program uses a function named to find. To describe a company, it uses the Company.h file, which you are also given.

Your task is to study the code in Main.cpp, then create a file called Find.h (which Main.cpp includes) containing the definition of the find function, written in such a way that Main.cpp compiles successfully and works as described above.

You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the Find.h file. The Judge system has a copy of the Main.cpp file and will compile it along with your Find.h file in the same directory.

To correctly use the Company definition, without interfering with its usage by Main.cpp, use the following structure for the Find.h file:

Find.h
#ifndef FIND_H
#define FIND_H
#include "Company.h"
// Place your code here, as well as any other #include directives you might need
#endif // !FIND_H

Examples

Output
itjoro 878968302

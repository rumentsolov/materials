/*
You are given code that reads a series of integer numbers and does an “aggregation” on them, which results in a
single integer. Aggregation types are one of:
•
•
sum – sums the items in the series into a single integer
average – calculates the average of the series, as calculated by the integer division of the sum and the
number of items in the series
• min – finds the minimum integer in the series
The provided code handles input and output but lacks the functionality for the aggregations – you need to
implement them so that the code compiles successfully and accomplishes the task described.

Input
average
4 8 -2

Output
3

Input
min
4 8 2

Output
2

Input
sum
4 8 -2

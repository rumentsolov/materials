/*
You are given code that reads a line from the console, then reads the definition of a filter, applies the filter (which
removes some of the symbols from the input), and prints the output. The filter types are:
•
•
•
A-Z – removes all capital letters
a-z – removes all non-capital letters
0-9 – removes all digits
However, the code only defines the main() function and a base Filter class. Your task is to implement the
specific filter in each case.
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the file(s) YOU created. The Judge system has a
copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

/*
You are given code that reads information about one of 3 possible shapes
• a Circle (defined by radius and center)
• a Rectangle (defined by width, height, and center)
• a CoordinateSystemCenter (not really a shape, always has (0, 0) as its center and an area of 0)
The provided code does not have the definition for the base Shape class – your task is to create it and any members
necessary for the code to compile and accomplish the task described.
Examples
Input
c 1 3 2

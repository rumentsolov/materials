/*
You are given code for a program, which finds the minimum element of a list of strings entered on the console
(lowercase English letters, separated by spaces). The program has 3 modes of operation, each using a different
characteristic for finding the minimum:
•
•
•
Lexicographical minimum i.e. find the string that is earliest lexicographically
Size minimum i.e. finds the shortest string
Reverse size minimum i.e. finds the longest string
The code is missing the MinBy.h file. Your task is to study the provided code and create a MinBy.h file such that
the program compiles successfully and performs the described task.
Your MinBy.h file should resemble the following:
MinBy.h
#ifndef MIN_BY_H
#define MIN_BY_H
// Place your code here
#endif // !MIN_BY_H
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the MinBy.h file. The Judge system has a copy of
the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
Restrictions
There will always be at least 1 string in the list of strings entered from the console. There will be no empty strings.
Examples

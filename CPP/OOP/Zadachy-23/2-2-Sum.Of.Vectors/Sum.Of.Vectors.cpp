Elements data 2
The number of couples is an integer, the datas are strings.
With the couples in the data vectors, you have to create a new vector with the concatenation of the previous 2
vectors’ data.
Write a function that does the concatenation
Your task is to study the code in Main.cpp and implement the SumOfVectors function in SumOfVectors.h
(which is #include-d by Main.cpp), so that Main.cpp compiles successfully and accomplishes the task described.
Your SumOfVectors.h file should resemble the following:

#ifndef SUMOFVECTORS_H
#define SUMOFVECTORS_H
// Place your code here
#endif // !SUMOFVECTORS_H
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the SumOfVectors.h file. The Judge system
has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

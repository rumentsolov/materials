/*
You are given a program in a MemoryMain.cpp, as well as a Company.h file, that reads information about
companies and writes it to the console.
Each company has:
-
-
-
An id (an integer between 0 and 255)
A name (a string containing a sequence of lowercase English letters a-z)
Employees by their initials (a vector of pairs of characters, containing at most 255 employee initials)
The MemoryMain.cpp file reads the information from the console, as a sequence of byte values, stores those bytes
in memory (RAM), and then calls a function named readCompaniesFromMemory, passing it two parameters:
-
-
a pointer to the first byte in the memory containing the companies
an integer indicating the number of companies stored in the memory
The memory format of each company is the following:
-
-
-
-
the first byte contains the id of the company (0-255)
the name of the company starts from the second byte and ends with a null terminator (the value 0, or
'\0'), i.e. the name of the company is placed in memory the same way a null-terminated C-String would be
the next byte contains the number of employees the company has (0-255). Let’s call it numEmployees
the following numEmployees * 2 bytes contain pairs of initials of the employees, i.e. if the
numEmployees byte is at address x, then the first employee’s first initial is at address x + 1, and their
second initial is at address x + 2, the second employee’s first initial is at address x + 3 and their second
is at address x + 4 and so on.
The MemoryMain.cpp file will print the companies in the format:
-
company id, space, company name, space, opening bracket '(', first initial of first employee, dot '.', second
initial of first employee, dot '.', first initial of second employee, … , closing bracket ')'
For example, if we have the companies:
-
id = 42, name = "uni", employees = { {'I', 'K'}, {'S', 'N'} } and
id = 13, name = "joro", employees = { {'G', 'G' } }

Their representation as strings printed by MemoryMain.cpp will be:
42 uni (I.K.,S.N.)
13 joro (G.G.)
Their representation in memory, assuming the memory starts at byte address M, will be:


Offset from start : 0   +1  +2  +3  +4   +5  +6  +7  +8  +9  +10  +11  +12  +13  +14  +15  +16  +17  +18
Value :            42   'u' 'n' 'i' '\0'  2  'I' 'K' 'S' 'N'  13  'j'  'o'  'r'  'o'  '\0'  1   'G'  'G'

And their representation in the input for the task will be:
42 117 110 105 0 2 73 75 83 78
13 106 111 114 111 0 1 71 71
end
Your task is to create a file called CompanyMemoryUtils.h (which MemoryMain.cpp includes), containing the
function readCompaniesFromMemory, implemented in such a way that MemoryMain.cpp compiles successfully
and works as described above – i.e. your task is to read the memory, which will be in the format described above,
and return a vector<Company> containing the companies that were written in that memory.
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the CompanyMemoryUtils.h file. The Judge
system has a copy of the other files and will compile them along with your CompanyMemoryUtils.h file in the same
directory.
NOTE: you are also given the code for the test generator used to generate the tests in the judge system, in C#.
Compiling and running it will produce random tests (.in.txt input files and .out.txt output files) similar to
those in the Judge system, which you can use to test your code locally.

Input :
42 117 110 105 0 2 73 75 83 78
13 106 111 114 111 0 1 71 71
end

Output :
42 uni (I.K.,S.N.)
13 joro (G.G.)

Input :
188 105 99 121 104 97 0 3 66 81 72 80 70 83
58 117 97 100 101 108 0 3 83 65 67 72 76 84
end

Output:
188 icyha (B.Q.,H.P.,F.S.)
58 uadel (S.A.,C.H.,L.T.)
